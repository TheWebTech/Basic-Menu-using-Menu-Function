## Menu Module starter

---

This is a basic menu module to use as a starter for your own menus using the HubSpot `menu()` function.
Intentionally it does not have any CSS of it's own. When popped into a page using HubSpot's [boilerplate css](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tools/boilerplate-css) however it will render just like the HubSpot menu tag menu's do.

You can then easily modify the html to fit your specific needs to build mega menus or other advanced features.
